          `statement_time_ge` and `statement_time_le` together constitute the creation time filter condition.
          - If `statement_time_ge` is filled but `statement_time_lt` is empty, `statement_time_lt` will default to the current time.
          - If `statement_time_lt` is filled but `statement_time_ge` is empty, `statement_time_ge` will default to the earliest shop time.

          **Example:**
          As statements are generated daily at 00:00 UTC, to retrieve statements for the period from Oct 5 to Oct 10, configure the parameters as follows:
          - Set `statement_time_ge` to 00:00 on Oct 6  or any time on Oct 5 (excluding 00:00).
          - Set `statement_time_lt` to any time on Oct 11 (excluding 00:00).

        Use this API to confirm an order split. Note that ​​supported split levels vary by region​​:

        - Others only support ​​all-units splits​​ (splitting different SKUs into separate packages).

        Here are two examples of supported splits:
        - ​​**Case 1**: all-units split​​, applicable for orders in BR, SEA, MX (local sellers)
        Split a buyer order of SKU A of quantity 2 and SKU B of quantity 1 into two separate packages:
          - ​​Package 1​​: all units of SKU A
        ​​  - Package 2​​: all units of SKU B

        - **​​Case 2**: item-level split​​, applicable for orders in EU, JP, MX (global sellers), UK, US
        Split the same order contents into three individual packages:
          - ​​Package 1​​: 1 unit of SKU A
        ​  - ​Package 2​​: 1 unit of SKU A

        Retrieve the list of product categories available for your shop.
        Product categories are updated frequently, so it's recommended to call the API in real time to ensure you are using the latest category data. Caching category data locally may result in using outdated information, leading to errors when creating products.
        **For the Indonesia market**: To list a product on both TikTok Shop and Tokopedia, you must use only categories that are available on both platforms. Please call this API twice to identify the overlapping categories.

        Retrieve the standard built-in product and sales attributes for listing a product in a particular category based on your shop's location.
        Products on TikTok Shop are grouped into categories predefined by TikTok Shop, and each category is associated with a standard set of product attributes and sales attributes.

        Use this API to determine the mandatory and optional attributes before listing a product.

        Create global products to be sold in one or multiple shops outside of the seller's base country.
        You can only create global products in `AVAILABLE` product categories. For other categories, contact your account manager for assistance. After product creation, use the [Publish Global Product API](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/650a64d6defece02be678fd6) to publish and translate the product in the desired markets.
        **Key concept**: Global products are products created by cross-border sellers to be sold in shops outside of their base country. With global products, cross-border sellers operating across multiple markets can avoid creating the same product for each shop individually. Instead, they just need to create a single global product, which can be published and synced to all their shops, simplifying product management across markets.
        **Note**:
        - This API is applicable only for intra-EU sellers and global sellers. To create and list local products intended for sale exclusively in local shops, use the [Create Product API](https://partner.tiktokshop.com/docv2/page/6502fc8da57708028b42b18a) instead.
        - There may be a limit to the number of products you can list per day. We recommend prioritizing the creation of key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage.
        - The language used in the product content must align with the target market's language (e.g. don't use Chinese), otherwise the listing will fail or be rejected.

        **IMPORTANT**: For published products, the changes will be automatically retranslated and synced to all markets where the product is published. If you have already edited the product information or translations of the associated local products, they will be overwritten by the information in this API. For example, if you have customized the local prices such as the local pre-tax price or the local display price, they will be overwritten each time this API is called.
        **Note**:
        - There may be a limit to the number of products you can relist per day. We recommend prioritizing key products first to ensure they get published. You can find your listing limit on the Seller Center homepage.
        - All inputs, including blanks, in the request payload will overwrite existing values. To retain an existing value, make sure to include it in your request. Therefore, **it is strongly recommended to retrieve the latest product data using [Get Global Product](6509e2b0bace3e02b7490c96) and submit the complete data when editing**. This ensures accuracy and helps avoid errors or unintentional data loss due to missing fields.

        **Note**:
        - Updates are handled per top-level property, so all non-empty fields within an updated object must be supplied to prevent overwriting with blanks.
        - For top-level properties (e.g. `name`, `email`) that are not nested in an object, you can update them individually. Omitting these properties in the request will leave them unchanged.
        - If you need to edit any nested property within an object, you must provide values for all nested properties of that object. Any omitted nested properties will be overwritten with blanks. For example, if you want to update `phone_number.local_number`, you must also include the `country_code` property to avoid data loss for that property.

            **Note**:
            - For the US market, refer to [TikTok Shop Restricted Products Policy](https://seller-us.tiktok.com/university/essay?identity=1&role=1&knowledge_id=3238037484275457&from=policy) for information on product category restrictions.
            - For the Indonesia market, to list a product on both TikTok Shop and Tokopedia, you must use only categories that are available on both platforms.

            - The content must conform to the [HTML syntax](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/). All HTML tags are accepted but to optimize display on the TikTok Shop product detail page, the system will automatically convert certain tags into alternative formats, such as rendering `<table>` tags as images.
            - Max length: 10,000 characters.
            - Images must use TikTok Shop image URLs, not exceed 4000px, and include `src`, `width`, and `height` attributes.
            **Recommendations**:
            - If you are syncing a pre-existing description from another platform, include the full HTML source description here.
            - Provide a detailed description, ideally over 300 characters.
            - Include 3-5 key selling points, each under 250 characters, with supporting images.
            - Use 1600x1600 px for the image dimensions.
